# SMS SPAM DETECTION 
The MA336 Final Project focuses on creating a robust SMS spam detection system using machine learning and AI techniques. 
The project employs the SMS Spam Collection dataset, consisting of 5,574 labeled SMS messages, to train a model capable of accurately distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages. 
Feature engineering, natural language processing (NLP), and supervised learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are utilized in the project.

The data is further processed through text cleaning and preprocessing, including the removal of non-alphanumeric characters, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging. 
The project includes visualizations, such as density curves and word clouds, to provide insights into the characteristics of spam and non-spam messages.
# Result
Two machine learning models are implemented for spam detection: Random Forest Classifier and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 
The Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of approximately 96.23%, while the ANN model demonstrates a test accuracy of 97.39%.
# Conclusion
The conclusion highlights the strengths and considerations of both models. The Random Forest Classifier is praised for its simplicity and interpretability, making it suitable for accurate and understandable spam detection. 
On the other hand, the ANN, while slightly more accurate, is computationally expensive and less interpretable. 
The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of accuracy, interpretability, and computational resources.
